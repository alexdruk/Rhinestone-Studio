"""Which IMG-026E to H rules the pipeline applies on top of the prototype.

PROTOTYPE reproduces the prototype exactly (the equivalence and golden tests run with it);
BUILD_E, BUILD_F and BUILD_G are what builds E, F and G shipped; DEFAULT is what the service ships.
See docs/specifications/IMG-026-StrassLayoutService.md, "Layout quality (build E)",
"Colour and eyes (build F)", "Pupils and stone colours (build G)" and
"More catalogue colours (build H)".
